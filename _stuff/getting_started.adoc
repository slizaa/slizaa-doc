= Getting started

== Download and install

Download the latest slizaa distribution http://www.slizaa.org/download/[here]. The platform specific archive must be unpacked to an arbitrary folder on your local disc.
Start slizaa by double-clicking the slizaa executable that can be found in the installation directory.

== Creating software structure graphs with jQAssistant
If you start slizaa for the first time,
it opens the 'Graph Mapping' perspective as the default perspective (see figure 1).

The Graph Mapping perspective that is shown initially allows you to setup database connections,
to create and edit cypher queries and to execute them against a selected database, to map the flat Software Structure Graph stored in Neo4j
to an arbitrary hierarchical (in-memory) graph and more. The perspective mainly consists of the following viewers and areas:

. The *Project Explorer* provides a hierarchical view of the resources in your workspace.
. The *Editor area* is where you modify the contents of files in your workspace, e.g. cypher query files.
. The *Hierarchical Graphs Explorer* shows all mapped hierarchical (in-memory) graphs.
. The *Graph Databases Explorer* shows the graph database locations that you have added to slizaa.
. The *Query Result viewer* shows the result of a cypher query that you executed against a graph database instance.
. The *Uses/Used by viewers* show which nodes are referenced the selected nodes in the Hierarchical Graphs Explorer (Uses),
respectively which nodes are referencing the the selected nodes in the Hierarchical Graphs Explorer (Used by).

=== Install jQAssistant support
The jQAssistant distribution is not included in the slizaa distribution. In order to create your own local graph databases with slizaa, you have to install jQAssistant as a slizaa extension.
The easiest way to do so is to select `Help -> Install slizaa extension` in slizaa's main menu. This will open the Install Extensions dialog shown in figure 2.

Select 'jQAssistant distribution' and click through the wizard to finish the installation.

=== Create a new slizaa project
In order to work with slizaa, you have to create a slizaa project first. A slizaa project normally contains resources like graph database connection definitions, cypher queries, custom mappings and so on.
To create a new project, right click in the project explorer and select `New -> slizaa Project...`.

Specify the name of your project in the new project wizard (e.g. my_example_project) and click Finish.

=== Scan artifacts in a new jQAssistant database
With slizaa you have two different options for working with graph database instances:

. You can connect against a database instance that runs 'outside' from slizaa (that's what we call a _unmanaged remote database_), or
. you can create and start your own database instance from within slizaa (that's what we call a _managed local database_).

In both cases you have to define the database/database connection in a _database definition file_. To create a database definition file, right-click in the project explorer and select `New -> slizaa Database Definition File...`
