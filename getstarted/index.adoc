== Get started

slizaa allows you to inspect and visualize the structure of an application, but it does neither scan nor store the structural information by itself. Instead, it uses jQAssistant (which in turn uses Neo4J)
as it's backend. In order to setup slizaa, you have to install and run jQAssistant first (that is part 1 of this guide). Once jQAssistant is up and
running, you can start slizaa and connect against the running jQAssistant server (that's part 2 of this guide).

== Step 1: Install and run jQAssistant

[NOTE]
====
[big]*Lazy? Use the preconfigured example database!*

In the unlikely case the you don't want to scan your own application(s) yet, you can skip the entire first section by downloading a
preconfigured jQAssistant distribution http://www.slizaa.org/downloads/jqassistant-1.1.3-examples.zip[here]. The provided distribution contains two preconfigured examples database:

- _mapstruct_, which contains the structure information of Gunnar Morling's awesome java beans mapper (http://www.mapstruct.org), and
- _eureka_, which contains structure information of Netflix' eureka service registry (https://github.com/Netflix/eureka).

Simply unzip the content of the archive and start the graph database server by executing one of the contained scripts in the top level folder.

=== Install jQAssistant

Download the latest jQAssistant distribution http://jqassistant.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jqassistant.distribution-1.1.3-bin.zip[here]. The archive contains a directory 'jqassistant.distribution-1.1.3' that must be unpacked in an arbitrary folder on your local disc.

Further information regarding jQAssistant can be found at the http://jqassistant.org/[jQAssistant homepage, window="_blank"].

=== Scan you application
Put all the JAR files (or WAR files) that belong to your application in the '<jQAssistant_install_dir>/myApp' folder. The JAR files will be scanned during the scanning process using the following command.
The structural information will be stored in a Neo4J graph database that is located in the specified directory (e.g. 'jqassistant/myAppDB').

[square]
* _Windows_
[source,shell]
 .\bin\jqassistant.cmd scan -f myApp -s jqassistant\myAppDB

 * _Linux_
[source,shell]
 ./bin/jqassistant.sh scan -f myApp -s jqassistant/myAppDB

=== Enrich your application model
The model created by the scanner represents the structure of a software project on a raw level. jQAssistant uses so called concept rules to enrich the database with higher level information to ease
the process of writing queries. This typically means adding labels, properties or relations. While jQAssistant comes with a bunch of concepts to support different use cases, currently only the 'classpath'
concept must be applied:

[square]
 * _Windows_
[source,shell]
.\bin\jqassistant.cmd analyze -concepts classpath:Resolve -s jqassistant\myAppDB

 * _Linux_
[source,shell]
./bin/jqassistant.sh analyze -concepts classpath:Resolve -s jqassistant/myAppDB

=== Start the jQAssistant server
Now you are ready to launch the jQAssistent server that hosts the structural information of the scanned application.

[square]
 * _Windows_
[source,shell]
.\bin\jqassistant.cmd server -s jqassistant\myAppDB

 * _Linux_
[source,shell]
./bin/jqassistant.sh server -s jqassistant/myAppDB

To verify if your jQAssistant is up and running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:7474.

== Step 2: Install and run slizaa

=== Install and start slizaa

Download the latest slizaa distribution http://www.slizaa.org/download/[here]. The platform specific archive contains a directory 'slizaa' that must be unpacked in an arbitrary folder on your local disc. Start slizaa by double-clicking the slizaa executable that can be found in the slizaa installation directory.

=== Connect to the local jQAssistant server
Choose one of the following provided mappings:

- Java mapping (flat packages)
- Java mapping (hierarchical packages)
